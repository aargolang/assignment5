# Library database

<p>This program is a linked list that stores information about books (or any inventory) and users. it saves the preferences upon exit and also reminds the user how many books are overdue. </p>

Improvements could be
* user data stored as binary file.
* user data stored in an encrypted file with a basic 8bit key encryption
* information stored could be templated in order to be a generic user login/ inventory system.
